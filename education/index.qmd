Research Topic: Comparing the utility of digital footprint data with existing methods on flood risk management and
data injustice mitigation, a case study of Nairobi, Kenya

Research Plan: Developing a workflow to assess the performance of digital footprint data in flood risk management
by comparing with traditional methods in Nairobi, Kenya; Identifying digital invisible groups and
proposing mitigation approaches to empower these groups for data-enabled decision-making.

Over the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion.

Master Thesis: Distributed Ledger Technology enabled passenger control system to maintain social distancing on
public transport during COVID-19

Result & Outcome: Applied a resource-sharing algorithm to the public transport sector to control the movement of the
passengers. The system also came with a compliance scheme achieved by distributed ledger
technology. The model used smart card data from London underground to simulate pass

I am creating a comprehensive and detailed history of the conflict that goes beyond the surface-level events. By gathering information from a variety of sources, including my own memories, written accounts, and oral histories, I hope to shed new light on this important period in Middle-earth's history and provide valuable insights into the motivations and actions of the various players involved.
