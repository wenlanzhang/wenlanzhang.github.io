I am creating a comprehensive and detailed history of the conflict that goes beyond the surface-level events. By gathering information from a variety of sources, including my own memories, written accounts, and oral histories, I hope to shed new light on this important period in Middle-earth's history and provide valuable insights into the motivations and actions of the various players involved.
